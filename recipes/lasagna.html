<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with rich fillings like ground meat (often beef or pork), tomato sauce, and creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese. <p>The layers are repeated, creating a stacked structure, with the top usually covered in melted cheese, typically mozzarella or parmesan. Baked until golden and bubbling, lasagna offers a hearty, comforting combination of flavors and textures, with variations including vegetarian options and different regional takes across Italy and around the world.</p>
